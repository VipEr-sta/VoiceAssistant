# VoiceAssistant
I just started this project. There is no OOP yet but this code will be refactored soon.

# Setup

The .whl file is already there so all that needs to be done to install PyAudio is 

```
pip install PyAudio-0.2.11-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
```
These dependencies must follow:

```
pip install gTTS
```

```
pip install SpeechRecognition
```

```
pip install playsound
```
